## Generators-in-Scheme
> Project for Programming Paradigms with the topic being continuations: Call-with-current-continuation function in scheme

## Goal
> Aim of the project is to implement generators using continuations (more specifically call/cc in scheme). The generator will be for trees and will include comparative functions between the two including detecting the same value within two trees, seeing if two trees are the same, etc.
